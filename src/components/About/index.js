          Hello There! <br />
          My name is Jo√£o Gaspar. I am a full-stack Web Developer with a background in tourism.
        <br /> Unfortunately graduated at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, getting a job in the tourism area was hard. So in the lockdown, I found a new passion that was programming and decided to invest in a Bootcamp at Ironhack Lisbon.
